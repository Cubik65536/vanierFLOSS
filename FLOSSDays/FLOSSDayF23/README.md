The second edition of Vanier FLOSS Day happened on October 14th 2023, on a Saturday, just after the school

Unconference
============

The meeting was run in an [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) style. 
We started the day with an introduction to FLOSS and licenses, then we built the schedule with
topics collected from the registration form, plus some requets and offers of topics on the day.

To define the schedule we had a show of hands on the proposed topics and sessoins were ordered
taking into consideration its popularity as well as a few requests to accomodate when people
had to leave.

Lunch and snacks
================

At the beginning of the day, a snacks station was setup with coffee/tea/juice, fruits and pastries.
For lunch, once more we had pizza, since it was the easier way to handle dietary restrictions -
this time we had a wide variety: vegetarian, gluten-free, halal and kosher.
