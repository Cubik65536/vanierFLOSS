Vanier FLOSS Day - Fall 2023
==============================

The second edition of Vanier FLOSS Day happened on October 14th 2023, on a Saturday, just after the school
Fall break. All Vanier community was invited, through MIOs and a printed poster, as well as the outside
FLOSS community, since the event was posted at [Agenda du Libre](https://agendadulibre.qc.ca/events/2409).

An online form was setup and 29 people were registered prior to the event. On the day, 22 people checked
in, plus 1 baby and 1 accompaning family member, which participated in their own capacity. 

Checked-in participants
=======================

22 participants in total:

- X CST students
- 2 CST graduates

- 1 Pure and Applied Sciences
- 1 Computer Science teacher
- 1 Computer Engineering teacher


Unconference
============

The meeting was run in an [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) style. 
We started the day with an introduction to FLOSS and licenses, then we built the schedule with
topics collected from the registration form, plus some requets and offers of topics on the day.

To define the schedule we had a show of hands on the proposed topics and sessoins were ordered
taking into consideration its popularity as well as a few requests to accomodate when people
had to leave.

Lunch and snacks
================

Since the start of the day, we had a snacls station with coffee/tea/juice, fruits and pastries.
For lunch, once more we had pizza, since it was the easier way to handle dietary restrictions -
this time we had a wide variety: vegetarian, gluten-free, halal and kosher.
