# FLOSS projects

Here is a curated list of FLOSS projects that we use, we develop, or we contribute with the development somehow.

When adding a new project, try to list the following info:
* Project name & description
* Repository and bug tracking system
* Developers/community communication channel (mailing list, IRC, Jitsi?)
* Why this is part of our list (eg. we use, we develop, we contribute or want-to?)
* Skills needed to start contributing

TODO: Info brought from README, please develop in the template above: "Create a repository for Java Algorithms (Starting new project)"
