# FLOSS projects

Here is a curated list of FLOSS projects that we use, we develop, or we contribute with the development somehow.

When adding a new project, try to list the following info:
* Project name & description
* Repository and bug tracking system
* Developers/community communication channel (mailing list, IRC, Jitsi?)
* Why this is part of our list (eg. we use, we develop, we contribute or want-to?)
* Skills needed to start contributing

TODO: Info brought from README, please develop in the template above: "Create a repository for Java Algorithms (Starting new project)"

## Omnivox Scraper
This software is a creation of Vanier College's Computer Science and Mathematics student [solonovamax](https://github.com/solonovamax) and is shared under the [MIT license](https://github.com/solonovamax/Omnivox-Scraper/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

The majority of CEGEPs/Colleges in the province of Quebec uses Omnivox. The goal of this software is to *scrape* subdomains of ```vaniercollege.omnivox.ca``` i.e. retrieving data for further use in other softwares

The project is hosted on GitHub in the [solonovamax/OmnivoxScraper](https://github.com/solonovamax/Omnivox-Scraper) repository

There is no official communication channel at the moment, but GitHub issues can be used to report bugs for this project. Omnivox Scraper is an interesting project because it aims to enhance a tool that we (students enrolled in the Vanier College FLOSS club) use on a daily basis.

Contributing to this project is within almost everybody's reach. Here's the skills you'll need:
* Basic to intermediate Java OOP programming
* Basic XML skills
* Basic understanding of how Gradle projects work
* Access to Omnivox
