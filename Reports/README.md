# Report of Activities

It is important to keep track of what we do, to be able to celebrate later ;-)

You can use one of the reports available as a template, just create your own
name.csv and start tracking dates, tasks and hours spent. Please keep the file
in csv for readability.

If you intend to request STAR recognition, keeping an up-to-date report is a
must! If by any reason you prefer to keep a private report, make sure you MIO
it to Tassia on a regular basis.
