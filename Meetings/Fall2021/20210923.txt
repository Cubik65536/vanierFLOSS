  2. Brainstormed about the Debian-based live image for Vanier CST/CSM programs: 
   - Think about the design of logos for Vanier FLOSS club as well as other art to be possibly used for the image.
   - Possible project idea for LaunchBox (only a prototype is needed).

TODO: 
  1. Look up the licenses to the software used in the CST/CSM programs and find alternatives to the proprietary ones -
    as a first step towards designing the Debian live image. 
    The software gathered is currently listed in https://pad.riseup.net/p/I7mCZSsPSDlJkCXjzl2m.
  2. Research on how live images work and how to build and deploy one.
  3. Reorganize the meetings folder in our GitHub repository (make a folder per semester).
