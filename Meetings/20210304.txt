- [Off-topic] my hint for those "tab lovers": install the OneTab extension
  for your browser

- The homework from last week is still on: choose a FLOSS project and
  retrieve basic information for our collective list of potential projects
  to contribute. A few questions you might think about when selecting
  projects:
  - How popular is the project?
  - How complex is the project?
  - Is the project in active development?
  - Do developers use a public channel of communication?
  - Do they have many issues/bugs are open? Not necessarily bad!
  - Explore issues and try to find one that you understand.
  - Try to download the code and reproduce a bug.
  - What do you need to learn to start contributing?

The new meeting time worked pretty well. It was nice to see people
staying after 7, since no one had another class just after. We'll keep this
time for now, if it really doesn't work for you, please speak up and
we might run another pool in the future.

Happy hacking!
