Vanier FLOSS Club - meeting #6 (Mar 10)

Who was there:
- Mehdi Benouhoud
- kamyar karimi
- Angel Moreno
- Ron
- Tassia

An open call sent to all CSM and CST students. This meeting happened during
UB and was dedicated to explaining the GSOC and Outreachy programs: what they
are, who is eligible, which projects, how to apply

Consider GSOC/Outreachy tasks, as an entry point to FLOSS projects - this
could easily be your first contribution to a FLOSS project, even if you end-up
not applying or not being selected, it can be a worthy learning experience!

Everyone was invited to participate in the regular club meeting on Thursday.
