Vanier FLOSS Club - meeting #3 (Feb 17)

Who was there:
- Chilka
- Giuliana Bouzon
- Ilan Trutner
- Tassia Araujo

This time we had a small crowd, but still, we welcomed a new member and had nice
conversations about the FLOSS world, and brainstormed about activities we can
have in the club.

The git 101 tutorial was postponed to next week, or maybe the following one,
let's see when the presenters are ready.

In the following days, I'll try to create a few issues in our repository,
describing tasks that you could be working on - including those who can't attend
meetings but want to stay engaged. Whoever has a few hours to spare, it might be
time to start getting our hands dirty!

Finally, I just saw that a friend of mine has published his Master's thesis on
the topic: "What are the incentive structures of Free Software?". At the least
the blog post is worth reading, and if you feel motivated, there you can find
the link to the complete work:

Happy reading!

Tassia.
