Vanier FLOSS Club - meeting #9 (Apr 01)

Who was there:
- Giuliana
- Chilka
- Tassia

Another great chat about our interests and how that could converge into the
FLOSS world. I have described two projects I'm actively contributing to:

1) Debian
I've started drafting usability usability tests for the next Debian stable
release. In this pad you have many other related links and my brainstorm:
https://storm.debian.net/grain/rPQJdXqmCLykNfHY2uLeCG
If you are interested in helping, there are plenty of opportunities for any
knowledge level. Please let me know, and I'll probably get this rolling over the
summer.

2) Saskatoon
The harvest management system used by the fruit picking collective Les Fruits Defendus.
http://www.lesfruitsdefendus.org
https://github.com/LesFruitsDefendus/saskatoon-ng/
We need help with translation, testing, documentation, and coding in python,
django, CSS+Javascript (bootstrap) We'll actively welcome new contributors in a
few weeks, so if that is something you might be interested in, please let me
know!
