Vanier FLOSS Club - meetings #8 (Mar 25)

Who was there:
- Kamyar
- Tassia

With this small crowd, we had a nice 1-on-1 conversation about our interests and
how that could be developed in the FLOSS world. Most of the chat revolved around
game development, and we also talked about working in a team, like Debian games.
Here are a few links for future reference:

And here is an article that was posted on the Debian games team IRC this week:
"The complete guide for open sourcing video games"

I've also selected 3 FLOSS games that were developed in Vanier, and at least one
of the authors has participated in the FLOSS club:

https://github.com/gbouzon/dragonRush
https://github.com/chilkacastro/Final-Toby-s-Adventure-Game
https://github.com/DavidAnoTrudeau/Empirium

Those three are developed with the Greenfoot game engine.

Take a look at their repo, build and play their games, and we can ask the
authors to present their game to the club. Even if the original authors are not
interested in pursuing with the development, if there are other people
interested, we have a potential for collaborative work. That's the beauty of
FLOSS!
