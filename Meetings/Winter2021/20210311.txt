- Tassia

Summary:

- Another meetings dedicated to explaining the GSOC and Outreachy programs:
  what they are, who is eligible, which projects, how to apply

- Consider GSOC/Outreachy tasks, as an entry point to FLOSS projects - this
  could easily be your first contribution to a FLOSS project, even if you
  end-up not applying or not being selected, it can be a worthy learning
  experience!

- There is a lot going on this week in the FLOSS world, here are 3 events that
  I will participate, and invite you to come along:

  1) Debian packaging workshop (3h), Friday @ 9 am
     If you are not yet a Linux user, it might be a bit overwhelming, but
     interesting if you are brave! If you are a Linux user, come and see how
     packages are built!
