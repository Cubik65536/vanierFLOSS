Vanier FLOSS Club - meeting #10 (Apr 08)

Who was there:
- Giuliana
- Chilka
- Sarah Steiner
- Ron
- Tassia

GSOC deadline is approaching (April 13) and this meeting was mostly dedicated to
help those planning to apply, looking at their chosen projects and finding
answers to their questions about the program and the application process.

Good luck to Ron and Sarah!

Now, back to the club, it is getting to the end of the term, and it is normal
that attendance dropped, since we are all REALLY busy. But even if we don't have
time to do any FLOSS-related work outside those meeting times, in my opinion, it
is still worthy to meet and chat, help each other, and soon start talking about
our plans for the summer and for the Fall term.

In any case, maybe it is time to re-check our meeting time? If you still plan to
attend a club meeting this term, please answer the pool below with your
availability (dates are for next week, but the winning time will be kept until
the end of the term). I'll wait until Tuesday at noon to announce the meeting
time next week.

Finally, regardless if you plan to attend meetings, if you are still here and
would like to be kept in the loop, please respond to this message. I think we
should create a mailing list to communicate better off-MIO, especially during
the summer months. Send me your email address if you want to be included.
