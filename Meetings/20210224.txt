  https://github.com/tassia/vanierFLOSS/
  - Improved README (still with pending TODO tasks)
  - New folders: Meetings, Presentations, Reports

  https://github.com/tassia/vanierFLOSS/blob/main/Presentations/GitHub.pptx

- The homework of this week is for each of us to choose a FLOSS project and
  retrieve basic information for our collective list of pontential projects to
  contribute:
  - Name of the project
  - Description
  - Repository of code
  - Bug tracking system
  - Developers/community communication channel
  - Anything else you find pertinent

Next scheduled presentation is Python 101 by Giuliana. She can't present next
UB, so let's take this opportunity to re-check our meeting time, since
attendance has changed a lot in the past few weeks. This way we give
another opportunity for folks who can never be there during UB.

Please respond to the pool until Tuesday by noon:

If UB is still the best choice, we will stick to it and Python 101 will be
postponed to the following week. Otherwise, we'll experiment meeting in a
different time from now on.
