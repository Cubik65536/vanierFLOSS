Vanier FLOSS Club - meeting #1 (Feb 3)

Who was there:

- Gevorg Markarov
- Kosta Nikopoulos
- Saqib
- Chilka
- Anthony Nadeau
- Danich
- Carmelo S.
- Shahe Bannis
- Giuliana Bouzon
- Mgrdich Michael Derderian
- Devrin Aiden Tiongson
- Tassia Araujo

Here the list of important take-home messages from the meeting:

- Club meetings should not look like a classroom, we already have enough of that
- Tassia is not playing the teacher, but the mentor/advisor
- Participation in video is encouraged, it will allow us to recognize each other
  when we go back to campus!
- Attendance will be taken, just for the records
- If you are interested in using the club activities for STAR recognition,
  please keep a record of your FLOSS dedicated hours of the week, and talk to
  Tassia to start sending reports
- Any FLOSS-related activity is a valid: reading, studying, reporting bugs,
  fixing bugs, translating, designing logos, making music with or about FLOSS,
  and the list goes on...
- Once we have a better idea of what the club is, what do we do, who is welcome
  to participate, etc - as a written document-, we will be able to announce the
  club to all students
- For now, you are free to invite people. Try to give some background so they
  understand what is going on when they first land in our channel
- Two students volunteered to present next week: Carmelo and Devrin(?). If you
  are still not too sure about what FLOSS is, you should not miss next meeting!

The next meeting will happen next Wednesday during UB, so if you can't make it
again, please speak up and we'll think of an alternative.

Happy hacking!
