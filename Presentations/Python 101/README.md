# Python 101

Python is an interpreted  high-level general-purpose programming language. It's often the programing language that data scientists and statisticians learn because it's really begginer friendly. If you interested in Python, I suggest you checkout some third-party libraries that can really help you make impressive projects.

* pypi
* tkinter

## Hi, reader

Python's syntax is different from most programming languages you're probably familiar with.
For example, here is how you would write a function that says hi to someone:

### in Java

```java
public static void printHi(String name) {
   System.out.println("Hi, " + name);
}

printHi("Mehdi");
```

### and in Python

```python
def print_hi(name):  
  print(f'Hi, {name}') # The indent of this line is very important,
					   # it makes Python understand what's inside the method
print_hi('Mehdi') # ...and what's not!
 ```

## Hangman

[Giuliana](https://github.com/gbouzon) coded a version of the classic word game in both Python and Java (a programing language that most Vanier FLOSS club members are familiar with) to show the differences between the two languages.

### How to execute the code

Either download the repository zip folder or clone it using *git*

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/tassia/vanierFLOSS/
```
Move inside the repo

```bash
cd vanierFLOSS
```

#### Java

Make sure you have JDK install and up-to-date 

Either open ```Presentations/Python 101/JavaHangman``` on your IDE or execute the code on your terminal

```bash
cd Presentations/Python\ 101/JavaHangman/src/demoH
java Hangman.java
```

#### Python

Make sure Python 3 is install.

Either open ```Presentations/Python\ 101/Hangman``` on your IDE or execute the code on your terminal

```bash
cd Presentations/Python\ 101/Hangman
python3 main.py
```
