# How to Talk to the Debian Community - A Guide

The Debian community uses primarily IRC but for those of us who have never heard of it, it can be hard to get started and join some channels.
This guide provides a more user friendly way to reach the community using Element. 

Element is a web application built on the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/try-matrix/) open standard and allows different organizations to communicate independently on their own "social network". The Matrix IRC Bridge provides us with a way to pass IRC messages to Matrix and vice-versa.

In our case, we use Element as a Matrix client where the Matrix IRC Bridge allows us to exchange messages between Matrix and IRC. This unlocks new features that we're unable to get with a standalone IRC client, like getting notifications on your phone. 

1. To use Element on debian social, first we need a Debian Salsa account. 
    This is how you can get started: [Debian Salsa](https://wiki.debian.org/Salsa)

2. After creating an account, go to [Element](https://element.debian.social/)
   The page should look like this: ![Debian Element](/img/element_welcome.png)

3. Click on `Create Account` and authenticate with Salsa

You should be directed to Element on Debian Social

To join a channel, just click on `Explore Public Rooms`. 
Some channels that might be good for beginners are:

- debian
- debian-quebec (if you reside in Quebec, Canada)
- debian-mentors
- debian-meeting

There are many other available Debian channels and you can find them listed here: [channels](https://wiki.debian.org/IRC)

Note: this is also available for mobile, but make sure that the homeserver is matrix.debian.social before authenticating.

**Congratulations, you've made it to Debian!**
