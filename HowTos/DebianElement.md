# How to Talk to the Debian Community - A Guide

The Debian community uses primarily IRC but for those of us who have never heard of it, it can be hard to get started and join some channels.
This guide provides a more user friendly way to reach the community using Element. 

1. To use element on debian social, first we need a Debian Salsa account. 
    This is how you can get started: [Debian Salsa](https://wiki.debian.org/Salsa)

2. After creating an account, go to [Element](https://element.debian.social/)
   The page should look like this: ![Debian Element](/img/element_welcome.png)

3. Click on `Create Account` and authenticate with Salsa
   ![Create Account](/img/element_create_account.png)

You should be directed to Element on Debian Social

Note: this is also available for mobile, but make sure that the homeserver is matrix.debian.social before authenticating.

**Congratulations, you've made it to Debian!**
