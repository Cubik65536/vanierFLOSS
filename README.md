## What is FLOSS?

It stands for Free/Libre and Open Source Software, and basically, it is software that respects users' freedom. In order to maintain human rights and civil liberties in the realm of software, below are the 4 essential freedoms as defined by the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).

### The 4 essential freedoms: 

  1. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
  2. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
  3. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
  4. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

## Where and when do we meet?

We use [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/) in our virtual meetings, a FLOSS solution
for video conferencing. Join [our channel](https://meet.jit.si/vanierFLOSS) and
make yourself at home! No accounte needed.

We have a weekly check-in on Thursday from 18:00 to 19:00, which
sometimes goes on a bit later. Club members work on their own FLOSS
activities over the week, and might plan additonal meetings as needed.

If you want to propose another meeting time, just find another person that is
available at the same time, announce to the club, then more people might
join as well!
