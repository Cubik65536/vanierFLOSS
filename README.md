## Where and when do we meet?

We use [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/) in our virtual meetings, a FLOSS solution
for video conferencing. Join [our channel](https://meet.jit.si/vanierFLOSS) and
make yourself at home! No accounte needed.

We have a weekly check-in meeting during Vanier UB, which is Wednesday from 12:00
to 13:00. Ideally, club members would be working on their FLOSS activities over
the week.

If you want to propose another meeting time, just find another person that is
available at the same time, announce to the club, then more people might
join you as well.
